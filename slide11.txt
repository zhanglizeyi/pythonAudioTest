Recall that we perform iterative local moves to minimize skew variation. We use three types of local moves. First, we displace the target buffer in eight directions and size the buffer. Second, we displace the target buffer and size its child buffer. Third, we re-assign the target buffer to a new driver.
However, each move will need placement legalization, ECO routing, RC extraction and timing analysis. And, each buffer can have around a hundred candidate moves. It is impossible to try all the moves. Then, which move is the best one? Our solution is to use a machine-learning based model to find the best move.
